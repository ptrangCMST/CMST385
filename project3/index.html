<h1>Kota The Friend</h1>

<div class="b">Avery Marcel Joshua Jones (born October 16, 1992), 
known by his stage name Kota the Friend, 
is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, 
and record producer, born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.
Kota the Friend released his debut mixtape, 
Palm Tree Liquor in 2016, followed by his second mixtape Paloma Beach in 2017.
In 2018, he released his first independent studio album Anything. 
In 2019, he released Foto, followed by Lyrics to GO, Vol. 1 in January 2020 and Everything in late May. 
Kota then went on to release Lyrics to GO, 
Vol.2 in January 2021 and To Kill A Sunrise with Statik Selektah in March 2021.
Kota the Friend has remained an independent act throughout his careerâ€”turning down 3 major record labels; instead, creating his own label and apparel store FLTBYS. 
He frequently cites a do-it-yourself mentality, 
such as filming his own music videos, recording within a home setup, 
and producing most of his discography. 
His mentality was fueled by a desire for freedom and to avoid the sense of musical confinement.
